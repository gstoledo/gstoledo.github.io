**Abstract** How should information be transmitted to the next generation in the aftermath of a
conflict? We propose a dynamic model where two groups engage in an infinite sequence
of conflict games with evolving costs, observed only when there are conflicts. Without
communication, conflict persists endlessly. Optimal communication by informed leaders
generates peace cycles and balances the important trade-off between how likely peace will
be versus how long it will last. This balance depends crucially on the baseline environment’s
stability. In highly unstable environments, optimal communication mimics static
Bayesian persuasion games. Conversely, in stable environments, optimal communication
implies only slight distortions in conveying history.
