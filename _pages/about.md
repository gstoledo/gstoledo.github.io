I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Economics at [Purdue University's Daniels School of Business](https://business.purdue.edu/undergraduate/academics/economics.php). I recently earned my PhD in Economics at [New York University](https://as.nyu.edu/econ.html). **I will be on the job market in 2025-2026**. 

I'm conducting research in Macroeconomics with particular interests in Labor and Firm Organization.

In 2024, I was a Dissertation Fellow at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and a PhD Summer Economics Fellow at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

My CV can be found [here](https://gstoledo.github.io/docs/Cv_GT.pdf)
